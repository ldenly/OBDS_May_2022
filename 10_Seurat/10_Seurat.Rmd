## Import scRNA-seq data and create a Seurat object

- Load the `Seurat` package.

```{r}
library(Seurat)
```

- Use the function `Read10X()` to import data in the directory `filtered_feature_bc_matrix/` 
  as an object named `read10x_data`.
  What class of object does the function return?

```{r}
read10x_data <- Read10X(
    data.dir = "/project/obds/shared/resources/4_r_single_cell/pbmc_5k/filtered_feature_bc_matrix/"
)
```

```{r}
class(read10x_data)
```

> Answer:
> 
> The function returns a `dgCMatrix`, which is a type of sparse matrix.
- Have a look at the object and its structure (e.g., first 15 rows and 6 columns).
  What is a sparse matrix and how does it store data?

```{r}
read10x_data[1:15, 1:6]
```

```{r}
str(read10x_data)
```

> Answer:
> 
> A sparse matrix stores only non-zero values.
> In a `dgCMatrix`, eah non-zero value is stored as:
> 
> - the index of its row
> - the index of its column
> - its value
> 
> The memory-efficiency of sparse matrices increase with the fraction of zero values
> in the matrix.
- How many features and barcodes (i.e., cells) are present in the data set?

```{r}
dim(read10x_data)
```

> Answer:
> 
> 33,538 features and 5,155 barcodes.
- Create a Seurat object using the function `CreateSeuratObject()`
  and the object `read10x_data`.
  Name the object `seurat_object`.
  Include features detected in at least 3 cells,
  and cells where at least 200 features detected.
  Name the project `pbmc5k`.
  How many features and barcodes are left in the Seurat object?

```{r}
seurat_object <- CreateSeuratObject(
    counts = read10x_data,
    project = "pbmc5k",
    min.cells = 3,
    min.features = 200
)
seurat_object
```

> Answer:
> 
> 19,037 features and 5,100 barcodes are left in the Seurat object.
- How many features and cells were filtered out when you created the Seurat object?

```{r}
dim(seurat_object) - dim(read10x_data)
```

> Answer:
> 
> 14,501 features and 55 barcodes were filtered out.
# Exercise

## Accessing the contents of a Seurat object

- Query the name of the default assay in the Seurat object.

```{r}
DefaultAssay(object = seurat_object)
```

- List the names of assays available in the Seurat object.

```{r}
Assays(object = seurat_object)
```

- Display the first six rows and six columns of the RNA assay data.
  What function do you use?
  Which arguments do you need to supply, and which ones are optional?

```{r}
GetAssayData(object = seurat_object)[1:6, 1:6]
```

> Answer:
> 
> The only required argument is the Seurat object.
> All other arguments are optional,
> because the default assay is already "RNA" and the default slot is "data".
- Display the entire data.frame of per-cell metadata (first six rows).
  What column names do you see?

```{r}
head(seurat_object[[]])
```

> Answer:
> 
> At this point, we see the column names `orig.ident`, `nCount_RNA`, and `nFeature_RNA`.
- Fetch one column of metadata using `[[`.
  What type of object do you get back?

```{r}
head(seurat_object[["nCount_RNA"]])
```

> Answer:
> 
> The `[[` symbol returns a `data.frame`.
- Instead,fetch the same column of metadata using `$`.
  What type of object do you get back this time?

```{r}
head(seurat_object$nCount_RNA)
```

> Answer:
> 
> The `$` symbol returns a named vector.
- Use the function `FetchData()` to access the library size and expression of the feature named `"LYZ"` (first six rows).
  What type of object do you get back?

```{r}
head(FetchData(object = seurat_object, vars = c("nCount_RNA", "LYZ"))[1:6, ])
head(rownames(seurat_object))
```

> Answer:
> 
> The function `FetchData()` returns a `data.frame`.
# Demo

## Common operations on Seurat objects

`WhichCells()` returns the names of cells that match a logical expression.

```{r}
WhichCells(seurat_object, expression = LYZ > 500)
```

`VariableFeatures()` returns the names of variable features (for a given assay, if computed).

```{r}
VariableFeatures(seurat_object)
```

`subset()` returns a new Seurat object restricted to certain features and cells.

```{r}
subset(
    x = seurat_object,
    cells = WhichCells(seurat_object, expression = LYZ > 300),
    features = VariableFeatures(object = seurat_object)
)
```

# Exercise

## Quality control and visualisation

- The library size and number of features detected per cell is already present in the Seurat object.
  Use the function `VlnPlot()` to display them in a single violin plot.

```{r}
VlnPlot(seurat_object, c("nCount_RNA", "nFeature_RNA"),pt.size = 0) #pt.size = 0 to get rid of points
```

- Use the function `PercentageFeatureSet()` to compute the fraction of reads
  assigned to mitochondrial genes in each cell.
  Store the metric in the cell metadata of the Seurat object, under the name `"percent_mt"`.
  Visualise this new metric alongside the previous two in a new violin plot.

```{r}
seurat_object[["percent_mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(
    seurat_object, pattern = "^MT-")
VlnPlot(seurat_object, c("nCount_RNA", "nFeature_RNA", "percent_mt"), pt.size = 0)
```

- Visualise a scatter plot of the proportion of mitochondrial UMIs against the library size in each cell.

```{r}
FeatureScatter(object = seurat_object, feature1 = "percent_mt", feature2 = "nCount_RNA")
```

- Create a new Seurat object, called `seurat_after_qc`, that is subsetted to cells that have more than 4,500 UMI counts, less than 15% of UMI counts assigned to mitochondrial features, and more than 1,500 features detected.
  How many cells were removed in this step?

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- subset(
    x = seurat_object,
    subset = nCount_RNA > 4500 & percent_mt < 15 & nFeature_RNA > 1500
)
seurat_after_qc
```

```{r}
dim(seurat_after_qc) - dim(seurat_object)
```

> Answer:
> 
> 896 cells were removed in this step.
# Exercise

## Normalisation

- Normalise the RNA assay of the Seurat object (after quality control) using the `"LogNormalize"` method.

```{r}
?NormalizeData
seurat_after_qc <- NormalizeData(
    object = seurat_after_qc,
    normalization.method = "LogNormalize"
)
```

## Bonus

- Visualise the distribution of raw counts and normalised data for a feature of your choice.

```{r}
ggplot_lyz_raw <- ggplot(FetchData(seurat_after_qc, vars = "LYZ", slot = "counts"), aes(LYZ)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "grey", color = "black", bins = 100) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 500)) +
    cowplot::theme_cowplot()
ggplot_lyz_normalised <- ggplot(FetchData(seurat_after_qc, vars = "LYZ", slot = "data"), aes(LYZ)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "grey", color = "black", bins = 100) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 500)) +
    cowplot::theme_cowplot()
cowplot::plot_grid(ggplot_lyz_raw, ggplot_lyz_normalised, ncol = 1)
```

# Exercise

## Variable features and scaling

- Identify variable features in the normalised RNA assay of the Seurat object.
  Use the `"vst"` method and select the 2,000 most variable features.
  What does this subsetting do, and what are our motivations for doing it?

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- FindVariableFeatures(
seurat_after_qc,
selection.method = "vst",
nfeatures = 2000
)
seurat_after_qc
```

> Answer:
> 
- What is the function to display the name of variable features in a Seurat object (e.g., first 10)?
  How can you control which assay the variable features are pull from?

```{r}
head(VariableFeatures(seurat_after_qc))
```

> Answer:
> 
- Use the function `VariableFeaturePlot()` to visualise the scatter plot of standardised variance against average expression.
  How would you use this plot?

```{r}
?VariableFeaturePlot
VariableFeaturePlot(seurat_after_qc,cols = c("black", "red"), pt.size = 0.5 )
```

> Answer:
> 
- Scale the normalised RNA assay of the Seurat object, regressing the library size and the fraction of UMI counts assigned to mitochondrial features.
  What are the motivations for removing those two sources of variation?

```{r}
head(seurat_after_qc)

seurat_after_qc <- ScaleData(seurat_after_qc,
    vars.to.regress = c("nCount_RNA","percent_mt"),
    features = VariableFeatures(seurat_after_qc)
)
print(seurat_after_qc)
```

# Exercise

## Dimensionality reduction

- Run a principal component analysis on the Seurat object.
  Which features are used by the method in the default settings?
  How could you change this?
  How do you read the message output of the function `RunPCA()`?

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- RunPCA(seurat_after_qc)
```

> Answer:
> 
> The help page of the function `RunPCA` states that if `features=NULL` (the default),
> only variable features for the assay are used.
> In other words, `VariableFeatures(seurat_after_qc)` gives you that list of features.
> 
> A custom set of features (e.g., all of them!) can be given to the argument `features`.
> The `RunPCA()` function produces a message in the console
> that shows the names of the features with the highest positive and negative loadings on a set of principal components.
> This gives a qualitative view that can help the intepretation of those axes of variation in the data set.
- List the names of dimensionality reduction results available in the Seurat object.

```{r}
Reductions(seurat_after_qc)
```

- Use `PCAPlot()` or `DimPlot()` to produce a scatterplot of the first and second PCA components.

```{r}
PCAPlot(seurat_after_qc)
```

## Bonus

- Make a scatterplot of the first and second PCA components yourself using `ggplot2`.

```{r}
# Use this code chunk to prepare a data.frame for ggplot2
pca_data <- FetchData(seurat_after_qc, vars = c("PC_1", "PC_2"))
head(pca_data)
```

```{r}
ggplot(pca_data, aes(PC_1, PC_2)) +
    geom_point(size = 0.2) +
    cowplot::theme_cowplot()
```

- Visualise the amount of variance explained the top principal components (number of your choice).
  How many principal components would you use for downstream analyses?

```{r}
ElbowPlot(seurat_after_qc, ndims = 50)
```

> Answer:
> 
> In this case, the first 20 components seem to capture most of the variance in the data set.
- Run the UMAP technique on your selected number of principal components and visualise the result as a scatterplot.

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- RunUMAP(seurat_after_qc, dims = 1:20)
UMAPPlot(seurat_after_qc)
```

# Exercise

## Clustering

- Compute the graph of nearest neighbours using the function `FindNeighbors()`.
  Which principal components are used by default?
  Instead, specify the number of principal components that you have chosen earlier.

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- FindNeighbors(seurat_after_qc, dims = 1:20)
```

> Answer:
> 
> The help page states that the function `FindNeighbors()` uses principal components 1 through 10, by default.
- What are the names of the nearest neighbour graphs that are now stored in the Seurat object?

```{r}
Graphs(seurat_after_qc)
```

- Then, compute cluster labels.
  What is the default setting for the `resolution` argument?
  Instead, set it to `0.5`.
  Do you expect more or fewer clusters following that change?
  What other parameters would you also try to experiment with?

```{r}
seurat_after_qc <- FindClusters(seurat_after_qc, resolution = 0.5)
```

> Answer:
> 
> The `resolution` argument has a default value of `0.8`.
> 
> A smaller resolution intuitively implies fewer clusters.
> We may take the time to confirm this in a bonus exercise, if we have time.
> 
> Other parameters that can have a major impact on clustering results include `algorithm`, `method`, and `modularity.fxn`.
>
> Also keep in mind that some parameters of the upstream `FindNeighbors()` function
> can affect the ability to find clusters in the resulting graph.
- Visualise the cluster labels on the UMAP scatter plot.
  How would you describe the agreement between the UMAP layout and the clustering results?

```{r}
UMAPPlot(seurat_after_qc)

#backup latest analysis Monday evening
saveRDS(seurat_after_qc, file = "/t1-data/project/obds/ldenly/ldenly/git/OBDS_May_2022/10_Seurat/seurat_after_qc.RDS")

#resume on Monday morning

```

> Answer:
> 
> Overall, good agreement.
> In particular, cluster labels appear quite homogeneous in areas of the UMAP plot.
> Also, there is not obvious over-clustering.
# Exercise

## Identify cluster markers

- Use the function `FindAllMarkers()` to identify
  positive markers for all clusters,
  filtering markers that are detected in at least 25% of the cluster,
  and with a log fold-change greater than `0.25`.
  Assign the result to an object named `seurat_markers_all`.
  What is the class of that object?
  How do you control the set of clusters that are used?

```{r}
seurat_markers_all <- FindAllMarkers(
    object = seurat_after_qc,
    only.pos = TRUE,
    min.pct = 0.25,
    logfc.threshold = 0.25
)
class(seurat_markers_all)
```

> Answer:
> 
> The function `FindAllMarkers()` returns a `data.frame`.
>
> The function uses the active identity in the Seurat object as a grouping variable.
> To use a different set of identities, use `Idents(seurat_after_qc) <- name` to use a different column of cell metadata as the active identity,
> before running the function `FindAllMarkers()`.
- How do you read the contents of the object `seurat_markers_all`?
  How do you know which features are the markers of each cluster?

```{r}
head(seurat_markers_all)
```

> Answer:
> 
> Each row represents a putative marker for one cluster.
> The columns `gene` and `cluster` indicate the name of the feature that is a putative marker for that stated cluster.
> The columns `p_val` and `avg_log2FC` provide differential expression statistics,
> while the columns `pct.1` and `pct.2` indicate the fraction of cells with detectable expression of the feature in each group of cells tested
> (group 1 is the cluster tested, group 2 comprises every other cell in the data set).
- Filter and display the top 10 markers for cluster 3.

```{r}
subset(seurat_markers_all, cluster == 3)[1:10, ]
```

- Visualise the expression of the top 4 marker for cluster 3 on a UMAP layout.

```{r}
FeaturePlot(
    seurat_after_qc,
    features = subset(seurat_markers_all, cluster == 3)[1:4, "gene"]
)
```

- Visualise the expression of those same 4 marker as a violin plot.
  Do you have any particular preference between the two types of plots?

```{r}
VlnPlot(
    seurat_after_qc,
    features = subset(seurat_markers_all, cluster == 3)[1:4, "gene"]
)
```

> Answer:
> 
> Scatterplots are prone to overplotting, which can sometimes be problematic as it unfairly hides data points behind others.
> It is also more challenging to compare the overall distribution of values in each cluster.
>
> Violin plots nicely separate each cluster, which makes it easier to compare the overall distribution of each feature in each cluster.
> However, this depends on the quality of the clustering.
- Use `DoHeatmap()` to visualise the top 10 (positive) markers for each cluster.
  Hint: you may want to use the function `dplyr::group_by()`.

```{r}
markers_top10_clusters <- seurat_markers_all %>%
    group_by(cluster) %>%
    top_n(n = 10, wt = avg_log2FC)
# or can subset top 10 by using slice_max(order_by = avg_log2FC, n=10)
#can also use following method to select by lowest p value (i.e. most significant) instead of highest fold change
markers_most_significant_10_clusters <- seurat_markers_all %>%
    group_by(cluster) %>%
    slice_min(order_by = p_val_adj, n=10)

DoHeatmap(
    object= seurat_after_qc,
    features = markers_top10_clusters$gene
)

DoHeatmap(
  object = seurat_after_qc,
  features = markers_most_significant_10_clusters$gene
)
```
